Electron data backup

This desktop application has been made with the purpose of making backup copies of certain files or directories and copying them to another directory or type of system (cloud pending) saving the paths of the files or directories to perform the bakcup so as not to have to perform the task of indicating the files or directories again.

The program will search the directories or files, copy them, compress them in a zip and move them to a destination path.
